# Machine Learning Model
This Repository contain my personal overview of the most important model of Machine Learning.


The models are:

- Linear Regression (Classic, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet)
- Logistic Regression
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Decision Tree (DT)
- Naive Bayes - Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forest (RF)
- Boosting Ensemble (Gradient Boosting Decision Tree)


----------------------------------
I create this repository studying books, follow online MOOC, and search information on the Web, in the folder "source" there are the most important resources that I've used.
